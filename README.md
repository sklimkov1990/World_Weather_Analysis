# World_Weather_Analysis

## Resources:
- Data Source: WeatherPy_Database.csv, WeatherPy_vacation.csv
- Software: anaconda3, python, jupyter notebook
- Library: matplotlib, matplotlib.pyplots, gmaps, gmaps.datasets, pandas, numpy, citipy, datetime, requests, and scipy

## Module Project Overview
While working on this project, I used various API libraries, in order to obtain desired minimum and maximum temperatures from user and populate a list of cities that fir the temperature parameters. After that, we displayed world map along with heat map layer and city markers added to it. That data will be the foundation of the further work.
